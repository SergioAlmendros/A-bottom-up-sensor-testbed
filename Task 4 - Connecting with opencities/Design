Design of the sketch (arduino) & script (python)

-The sketch will collect the sensor's data and send it to the script as an argument:
  python /mnt/sda1/main.py 1.92 2.83 45 112

-Python:
  
  1- Collect the data.
  2- Read a file (logData) to check if the new value is the same as the last writed value.
  3- If the value is equal, the script will do nothing, if is different, it will write down in a new line on the file.
  4- Create the GeoJSON.
  5- Do the POST to opencities.

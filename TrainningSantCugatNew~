NEW

  On Thursday 28th and Friday 29th of February the training week of the Code for Europe took place in ESADE, Sant Cugat. 
  
  Basically, in this two days, the organizers introduce a little bit of the Code for Europe to the new Fellows. For what I understand, a new fellow is hired every year, and he has 6 to 12 months to complete a project that will help their city.
  
  For instance, the fellows in Amsterdam create an app that allows the user to make their our route through the important places in the city (Take a hike!), or, a web that show the natural places of Edinburgh, like parks, monuments,... (http://www.edinburghoutdoors.org.uk/)
  
  Also, Llu√≠s Esquerda came to make a presentation about his project (http://citybik.es/), he did not explain to much about how it works, he focused the presentation on the problems he has had since he launched it, mostly because the companies of bike sharing did not want his server to get the public information that they put in their website.
  
  To finish the training we play a very interesting game (http://PlayGen.com) to create a first idea of an app game, each group create one game in only 1 hour.
